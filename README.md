Flowza - Development README
Overview

Flowza is a productivity and focus app that combines background music and Pomodoro time management to help users maintain focus while working or studying. The app plays pre-set or user-generated playlists and includes a timer to break work into focused intervals, promoting productivity and concentration.
Core Features to Implement

Here’s a breakdown of the main features that need to be developed for Flowza:
1. Landing/Home Page

    Purpose: Acts as the first screen users see when opening the app.
    Features:
        Welcome message and basic introduction to the app.
        Quick navigation to the Library, Now Playing, and Pomodoro Timer pages.
        Minimal, distraction-free interface.

2. Library Page

    Purpose: Display a list of playlists that users can listen to based on their mood or task.
    Features:
        Pre-set Playlists: Music designed for focus (lo-fi, instrumental, ambient).
        Custom Playlists: Allow users to create, edit, and save their own playlists.
        Playlist categorization based on task (e.g., "Study," "Creative," "Work").
        Playlist display with track names, album art (if available), and playtime.

3. Now Playing Page

    Purpose: Shows the current track playing and provides control for music.
    Features:
        Display track information (name, artist, album art).
        Play/Pause button, skip/rewind, and volume control.
        Option to add the current track to a custom playlist.
        Clean interface, focusing solely on playback control.

4. Pomodoro Timer Page

    Purpose: A Pomodoro timer to help users stay focused by splitting their time into work intervals.
    Features:
        Timer for work sessions (default 25 minutes) and breaks (default 5 minutes).
        After every 4 work sessions, a longer break (default 15 minutes) is triggered.
        Ability to customize the timer settings (work time, break time).
        Visual feedback (e.g., countdown timer, progress bar).
        Notifications when a session or break ends.

Technical Requirements
1. Tech Stack

    Frontend:
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using Electron to make it a cross-platform app).
        Optional: Use React.js or Vue.js if you'd like to structure the app in a component-based manner.
    Backend:
        Node.js to handle local file management (e.g., for storing playlists and music tracks) and time tracking for the Pomodoro timer.
    Audio:
        Howler.js or HTML5 Audio API for controlling audio playback (play, pause, skip, volume control).

2. App Structure

    Main Files:
        index.html – The main HTML file for the app's layout.
        app.js – JavaScript that controls the app's functionality, including interactions between pages and the music player.
        style.css – General CSS styling for the app's design.
        audioPlayer.js – Logic for controlling audio playback (play, pause, volume control, etc.).
        timer.js – Logic for managing the Pomodoro timer functionality (countdowns, breaks, notifications).
    Assets:
        Music files (stored locally or linked from a web source).
        Playlist data (JSON format for storing user playlists).
        App icons and artwork (for buttons, window icons, etc.).

Development Workflow
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowza.git

2. Install Dependencies

    Electron: The main framework for building cross-platform apps with web technologies.

npm install electron --save-dev

    Howler.js: For music playback.

npm install howler --save

3. Running the App Locally

    After installing dependencies, start the app with the following command:

npm start

    This will open up the Flowza app window with the basic home page.

Core Development Tasks

    Music Playback:
        Integrate Howler.js or HTML5 Audio API to handle audio files.
        Implement music controls (play, pause, volume control, skip).
        Add support for multiple playlists (pre-set and user-generated).

    Pomodoro Timer:
        Build a timer with adjustable session and break durations.
        Add notifications and visual progress tracking.
        Provide the option for users to customize the Pomodoro settings.

    User Customization:
        Allow users to create and save custom playlists.
        Store playlists in local storage or a simple JSON file.
        Provide an interface to edit, delete, and reorder playlists.

    App UI:
        Design a clean and minimal UI that supports focus.
        Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for responsive layout.
        Add smooth transitions for page navigation and music controls.

Future Improvements

    Persistent User Settings:
        Save user preferences (e.g., music volume, custom playlists, Pomodoro timer settings) to local storage or a database.

    Dark Mode:
        Implement a dark mode option for the app.

    Advanced Music Control:
        Support for more music platforms or APIs (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music).
        Create an API to fetch and display music metadata (e.g., track info, album artwork).

    Notifications:
        Add notifications for Pomodoro breaks or when a music track ends.
